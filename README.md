# Lab 9.2: Props and State

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will create an interactive character counter application that demonstrates state management and event handling in React. The application will allow users to input text and see real-time statistics about their input, including character count, word count, and reading time. This lab focuses on state management, event handling, and component interaction using React hooks.

## Objectives

### By the end of this lab, you will:

- Implement state management using the useState hook.
- Create and handle user events effectively.
- Build components that update their UI based on state changes.
- Implement the callback pattern for component communication.
- Create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
