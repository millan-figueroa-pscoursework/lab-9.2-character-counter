# Lab 9.2: Props and State

## Component Requirements

- [x] Create a TextInput component that handles user input and communicates changes to its parent.
- [x] Create a StatsDisplay component that shows various statistics about the text.
- [ ] Create a CharacterCounter component that combines the above components and manages the state.

## Activity Tasks

### Component Implementation:

- [ ] Implement each component according to its interface requirements.
- [x] Use useState to manage text input and statistics.
- [x] Implement event handlers for text changes.
- [ ] Calculate statistics in real-time.

### State Management:

- [x] Track the current text input.
- [ ] Calculate and update statistics when text changes.
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty input, very long text).

### Create a responsive layout.

- [ ] Show visual feedback for statistics.
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for word count goals.

### Component Communication:

- [ ] Use callbacks to pass data between components.
- [ ] Ensure proper prop typing.
- [ ] Handle optional props appropriately.

## Reflection Questions

- How did you handle state updates when the text changed?
- What considerations did you make when calculating reading time?
- How did you ensure the UI remained responsive during rapid text input?
- What challenges did you face when implementing the statistics calculations?

## Submission
